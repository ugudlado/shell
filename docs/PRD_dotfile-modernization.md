# PRD: Dotfile Modernization - dotfile-modernization

## 📋 Overview
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Branch**: `cu-perfect-gopher`  
**Assignee**: Claude  
**Created**: 2025-01-07  
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-20 12:34:00 IST (Final refinements: removed management scripts, enhanced symlink handling, VS Code diff integration)

## 🎯 Requirements
### Initial Requirements
- [x] **Primary Goal**: Modernize legacy dotfile setup to use current best practices
- [x] **Success Criteria**: Easy, reliable, cross-platform dotfile management
- [x] **User Impact**: Developers get consistent, modern development environment setup

### Detailed Requirements
- [x] **Functional Requirements**:
  - [x] Replace outdated tools with modern alternatives (mise, uv, starship, modern CLI tools)
  - [x] Cross-platform compatibility (macOS implemented, Linux/Windows planned)
  - [x] Simple configuration management (GNU Stow symlink-based)
  - [x] Easy installation and updates (Makefile commands)
  - [x] Backup/restore functionality (automatic backups with timestamps)
- [x] **Non-Functional Requirements**:
  - [x] Performance: Fast installation (<5 minutes)
  - [x] Security: No piped curl installations (official installers only)
  - [x] Usability: Single command setup (`make setup`) with comprehensive Makefile
  - [x] Maintainability: Clear, documented structure (docs updated)

## 🔍 Research & Analysis
### Problem Analysis
- **Root Cause**: Legacy setup using outdated tools and practices
  - Why is dotfile setup problematic? → Uses old versions and unsafe practices
  - Why old versions? → Setup from 2018, never updated
  - Why unsafe practices? → Piped curl installations, no verification
  - Why no updates? → No maintenance process
  - Why no maintenance? → No ownership or regular review
- **Current State**: Mixed shell scripts, Ansible, manual file copying
- **Desired State**: Modern, declarative, cross-platform dotfile management

### Investigation Notes
- **Codebase Analysis**: 
  - `install.sh`: Ubuntu-specific, uses piped curl (unsafe)
  - `local.yml`: Ansible playbook, partially implemented
  - Multiple installer scripts per OS, inconsistent
  - VS Code extensions managed manually
  - zsh with oh-my-zsh already in use
- **Architecture Review**: No clear architecture, scripts scattered
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Old NVM version (v0.33.8, current is v0.39+)
  - oh-my-zsh framework for zsh shell
  - Ubuntu-specific APT commands
  - Hard-coded paths and assumptions

### Knowledge Learned
- **New Discoveries**: 
  - Project has both shell scripts AND Ansible (inconsistent)
  - VS Code extensions list exists but not automated
  - zsh with oh-my-zsh already preferred and in use
  - Some modern tools already included (git, meld)
- **Assumptions Validated**: 
  - Primarily used on Ubuntu (APT-based)
  - Development-focused (VS Code, git tools)
  - zsh with oh-my-zsh preference confirmed
- **Constraints Identified**: 
  - Must maintain cross-platform compatibility
  - Cannot break existing workflows
  - Must be backward compatible during transition

## 🎨 Design
### Approach Evaluation
| Approach | Pros | Cons | Complexity | Decision |
|----------|------|------|------------|----------|
| Keep current shell scripts | Simple, familiar | Unsafe, unmaintainable | 2 | No |
| Pure Ansible | Declarative, powerful | Complex, overkill | 8 | No |
| Modern dotfile manager (chezmoi) | Best practices, cross-platform | Learning curve, complexity | 6 | No ❌ |
| GNU Stow + Makefile | Simple, transparent, universal | Basic functionality | 3 | **Yes** |
| Homebrew Bundle | Simple, Mac-first | Limited cross-platform | 4 | Partial |

### Selected Design
- **Architecture**: GNU Stow + Makefile-based dotfile management with OS-specific package managers
- **Implementation Strategy**: 
  1. Use GNU Stow for simple symlink-based dotfile management
  2. Comprehensive Makefile for all operations (setup, sync, edit, add, etc.)
  3. Use OS-specific package managers (Homebrew, APT, etc.)
  4. Maintain VS Code extension automation
  5. Modernize zsh/oh-my-zsh configuration management
- **Integration Points**: 
  - GNU Stow manages dotfiles via symlinks
  - Makefile provides unified command interface
  - Package managers handle tool installation
  - VS Code handles extension management
  - oh-my-zsh manages zsh configuration and plugins
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks, clear error messages, dry-run capabilities

### Technical Decisions
- **Technology Choices**: 
  - GNU Stow for dotfile management (simple symlinks)
  - Makefile for unified command interface (20+ commands)
  - Homebrew for macOS packages
  - APT for Ubuntu packages  
  - VS Code CLI for extensions
  - oh-my-zsh for zsh shell management
- **Patterns Used**: 
  - Symlink-based configuration management
  - Make targets for all operations
  - OS detection and conditional logic
  - Package manager abstraction
  - Automatic backup with timestamps
- **Trade-offs Made**: 
  - Complexity vs maintainability (chose maintainability)
  - Templates vs simplicity (chose simplicity)
  - Universal vs optimal (chose optimal per platform)
