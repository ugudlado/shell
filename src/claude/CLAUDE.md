# Global Development Guidelines

Spec-first workflow with OpenSpec, worktrees, and phase-based implementation.

## Core Workflow

### Autonomous Mode (preferred)

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/develop [description]` | **Full autonomous lifecycle**: specify → implement → iterate → complete |
| `/iterate [FEATURE-ID]` | Standalone improvement loop (code quality, UX, performance) |

`/develop` runs end-to-end with minimal human input. It asks only when genuinely blocked (ambiguous requirements, irreversible architecture decisions, external dependencies). Default bias: **proceed with assumptions** rather than wait for confirmation.

### Manual Mode (granular control)

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/specify [description]` | Architect+Researcher team creates OpenSpec change + worktree |
| `/implement [FEATURE-ID]` | Implementer→Reviewer→Verifier per-task loop + Architect signoff |
| `/complete-feature [FEATURE-ID]` | Archive + merge to main + cleanup |
| `/continue-feature [FEATURE-ID]` | Redirects to `/implement` (auto-resumes) |

### Utilities

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/opsx:propose`, `/opsx:apply`, `/opsx:archive`, `/opsx:explore` | OpenSpec commands |
| `/diagram`, `/commit-group`, `/release-prep`, `/reflect`, `/diagnose` | Utilities |

## Agents

| Agent | Model | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| `autonomous-developer` | Opus | Orchestrates full /develop lifecycle — drives all phases |
| `architect` | Opus | Drives spec design (/specify), validates implementation (signoff) |
| `researcher` | Sonnet | Explores codebase and docs on Architect's behalf (/specify) |
| `implementer` | Sonnet | Writes code per task (/implement) |
| `reviewer` | Sonnet | Per-task code review against spec (/implement) |
| `verifier` | Sonnet | Runs verification checks per task and at signoff (/implement) |

Agents communicate via `SendMessage` in named teams. The `autonomous-developer` agent orchestrates the specialist agents. General-purpose agents (`opus-agent`, `sonnet-agent`, `haiku-agent`) remain available for ad-hoc tasks.

## Autonomous Workflow State

`/develop` persists workflow state in `~/.claude/workflows/<slug>.json` for cross-session resumption.

**Flow hooks** (drive autonomous behavior):
- **`phase-gate.sh`** (SubagentStop): Enforces phase review ≥ 9/10 — blocks (exit 2) if score too low, forcing fix cycle
- **`iteration-gate.sh`** (Stop): Enforces iterate termination — injects continue/stop guidance based on quality scores
- **`auto-continue.sh`** (Stop): Saves phase + OpenSpec progress when session ends mid-workflow
- **`workflow-state.sh`** (SessionStart): Detects active workflows and injects resume context via additionalContext

To resume an interrupted `/develop`: just run `/develop` again (no args needed) from the feature worktree.

## OpenSpec Schemas

Three schemas, selected via `/specify --tdd|--rapid|--bugfix` or auto-detected from intent:

| Schema | Artifacts | Tests | Coverage | Use For |
|--------|-----------|-------|----------|---------|
| `feature-tdd` | spec → design → tasks | Before impl | >= 90% | Production features, APIs, libraries |
| `feature-rapid` | spec → design → tasks | Optional | N/A | Prototypes, spikes, tooling, DX |
| `bugfix` | diagnosis → fix-plan → tasks | Regression test | N/A | Bugs, regressions, incidents |

### Artifact Structure

```
~/code/feature_worktrees/[FEATURE-ID]/openspec/changes/[FEATURE-ID]/
├── .openspec.yaml      # schema, linear ticket, worktree config
├── spec.md             # Motivation + requirements + architecture (feature-tdd, feature-rapid)
├── diagnosis.md        # Symptoms + root cause (bugfix)
├── fix-plan.md         # Fix strategy + risk (bugfix)
├── design.md           # Technical design (feature-tdd, feature-rapid)
├── tasks.md            # Phased tasks with Why, Files, Verify per task
└── diagrams/           # Mermaid diagrams
```

Feature ID: `2026-03-02-slug` (date + slug) or `HL-80-slug` (with Linear)

### Task Structure

Tasks are managed via **Claude native task tools** (`TaskCreate`, `TaskUpdate`, `TaskList`, `TaskGet`). The `CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID` environment variable is set to the feature ID by the SessionStart hook, so tasks persist across sessions in `~/.claude/tasks/$FEATURE_ID/`.

Every task includes (in the `description` field):
- **Why**: Which requirement/bug this satisfies
- **Files**: Files to create or modify
- **Verify**: Concrete verification steps (not "should work")

Dependencies are wired via `addBlockedBy`/`addBlocks` on `TaskUpdate`.

**`tasks.md` is a generated read-only export** — written at phase gate commits for git history and PR review. Never manually edited.

Verification bugs get added as new tasks via `TaskCreate` — never skip to next phase with known issues.

## Critical Standards

1. **Spec-first**: Artifacts before implementation (schema determines which artifacts)
2. **Review gate**: `phase-review` skill at phase boundaries — score >= 9/10 required
3. **UI review**: `/critique` for any phase that touches UI components
4. **Verification bugs**: Issues found during verification become new tasks — never skip phases
5. **Auto-commit phases**: Commit after each phase passes review (no approval needed)
6. **Git**: Worktrees at `~/code/feature_worktrees/[FEATURE-ID]`, branches `feature/[FEATURE-ID]`, merge with `--no-ff`

## Memory

Search `claude-mem` at workflow start: `/mem-search [feature-id or topic]` to load prior decisions.

## Active Hooks (~/.claude/hooks/)

| Event | Hook | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| PostToolUse (Write\|Edit) | `auto-format.sh` | Prettier formatting (type-check via typescript-lsp plugin) |
| PreToolUse (Bash) | `bash-safety-guard.sh`, `spec-adherence-check.sh`, `rtk-rewrite.sh` | Safety + spec adherence + RTK token savings |
| PreToolUse (Write\|Edit) | `worktree-boundary.sh`, `protected-files.sh` | Prevent cross-worktree writes + guard lock files |
| Stop | `loop-detector.sh`, `task-complete-check.sh`, `iteration-gate.sh`, `auto-continue.sh` | Loop detection + task check + iterate termination + persist workflow state |
| SubagentStart | `subagent-task-context.sh` | Inject feature/task context into subagents |
| SubagentStop | `subagent-gate.sh`, `phase-gate.sh`, `task-complete-check.sh` | Subagent quality gate + phase review enforcement + task sync |
| SessionEnd | `session-reflect.sh` | Log sessions with errors for `/reflect` |
| Notification | `smart-notify.sh` | macOS notifications with distinct sounds |
| UserPromptSubmit | `task-gate.sh` | Remind to mark task [→] before coding |
| SessionStart | `session-git-status.sh`, `workflow-state.sh` | Git status + detect active autonomous workflows |

## Lessons Learned

- **pnpm add invalidates cached reads**: Re-read `package.json` after any `pnpm add` before editing it — the file is modified on disk and Edit will fail with "file modified since read."
- **CI=true for non-interactive pnpm**: Prefix `pnpm install/add` with `CI=true` in sandbox/non-interactive environments to avoid store path conflicts and TTY errors.
- **curl pipe to Python fails on non-JSON**: `curl ... | python3 -c "json.load(sys.stdin)"` fails silently if the server returns empty or HTML. Save to file first, verify content, then parse.
- **Session start: check git status**: Always run `git status` at session start and explicitly note whether prior session's changes are committed vs working-tree-only to avoid false "revert" confusion.
- **Verify component props before use**: Don't use props suggested by session summaries without reading the component interface first — summaries may describe non-existent props.
- **Use pnpm scripts over raw tool invocations in hooks**: Walk up to the nearest `package.json` with the script (e.g. `type-check`) and call `pnpm <script>` — avoids duplicating tsconfig paths and stays in sync with project config.
